# Overview

With this project, I am trying to make a fun top-down perspective farming game with Python Arcade.

This is a game where you can build and interact with animals. You move around with the arrow keys and
build by pressing the j key. You can push the cows around!

My purpose for writing this software was to have a fun and inspiring project to work on. I needed a
break from school projects.

I used VisualStudio Code as my IDE.

I used Python and the Arcade library to create this game.
